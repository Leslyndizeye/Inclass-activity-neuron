# Neuron Classifier

A basic Python class that simulates a single neuron for binary classification.

## What It Does

- Validates input feature count (`nx`)
- Initializes weights, bias, and activated output
- Performs forward propagation using sigmoid activation

## How to Use

```python
from neuron import Neuron
import numpy as np

neuron = Neuron(nx)
A = neuron.forward_prop(X)
```
